# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
  email: "foo@b.ar"
  first_name: "test1"
  last_name: "test2"
  subscription: <%= Date.tomorrow %>
  encrypted_password: <%= Devise.bcrypt(User, 'password') %>

two:
  email: "f@b.ar"
  first_name: "test3"
  last_name: "test4"
  subscription: <%= Date.yesterday %>
  encrypted_password: <%= Devise.bcrypt(User, 'password') %>
